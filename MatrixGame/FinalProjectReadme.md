## Instructions

In this project the main component is the thermistor which will give us the temperature. So, if you come near him or in contact with him with something cold or hot he will give different signals to other elements in this circuit. If you make him to get to a temperature bigger than 86 C he will start singing Megalovania from the game Undertale and will increase in the RGB Led the red colour. If you make him to get to a temperature lower than 86 C he will stop singing, or not sing at all and will increase the blue colour in the RGB Led.
With the potentiometer we will change the contrast of the screen and with the LCD we will display an animation and the temperature given by the thermistor at a certain moment.
